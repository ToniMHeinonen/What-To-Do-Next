    &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the app!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start by creating a new list by clicking the \"Lists\" button. &lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="add_list_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Creating lists&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First create a new list by clicking the \"List\" button.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="add_item_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Adding Activities&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add new activity by clicking the \"Add\" button. You need to add at least 7 activities in
        order to vote, if you are using the default settings. Once you have added 7 activities, you
        can go back and start voting.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="item_info_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Activity Info&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All you need to do is give your activity a name. You can skip the bonus and peril points if
        this is your first time voting. Usage of bonus and peril points will be explained once you
        have finished your first vote.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="vote_type_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Offline or Online?&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can vote locally by using the same phone and passing it around. You can also vote online
        if all of the voters have downloaded this app.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="offline_vote_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Offline Vote&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select the correct list which contains all of the activities which you want to vote on. After
        that create a new profile for each voter.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="online_vote_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Online Vote&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Voting online requires that all of the voters have installed this app. You need to give
        a nickname for yourself in order to vote, regardless of if you are hosting or joining.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;Hosting:&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to host a new vote room, just give a random 4 letter sequence as the room code.
        You also need to have enough activities in your selected list in order to start hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;Joining:&lt;/h5&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to join a vote room, you need to use the same room code as the one who has
        hosted the room. Ask your friends if anyone has already made a vote room.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="vote_top_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Voting&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are using the default settings, you need to vote top 7 activities from the list. The
        activities which receive the most points will move on to the next round. Only 7 activities
        can move on to the next round (except if activity 8 and so on has the same amount of points
        as the 7th activity).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After that you vote again on the remaining activities, but this time you will vote the top
        5 from that list, if you are using the default settings.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="last_results_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Last Results&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now that you have finished the last vote, you get to see the final results. Select the
        activities which you and your friends are going to do and click the \"Save and Exit\"
        button.&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="vote_complete_tutorial_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;Voting Complete&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You have now finished your first vote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All of the activities that made it to the last vote received 1 bonus point and all of the rest
        activities received 1 peril point. If you are using the default settings, then the
        activities which have more than 5 peril points will drop out of the list and you can\'t
        vote on them on the next vote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you want to vote on a dropped activity, you can retrieve it from the \"Fallen\" list,
        which can be opened from the \"Lists\" menu. By dropping the activities which do not make
        it into the last vote ensures that the activities which the majority don\'t want to do will
        fall away from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You should now know the basics pretty well. Make sure to check out the settings so that you
        can customize the app to your liking. Keep on voting!&lt;/p&gt;</string>

    <string name="beta_online">
    &lt;h1&gt;Online Beta!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Online voting is still in beta stage. Don\'t worry, your activities will not get lost or
        altered if something goes wrong. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;Note: Vote rooms will be removed after 2 hours has passed from their creation.&lt;/h5&gt;</string>

    <string name="no_registration_text">
    &lt;h1&gt;No Registration&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don\'t register, you can only join online votes. If you want to enjoy all of the
        features that this app has to offer, you need to register an account.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h5&gt;Note: Registration is completely free!&lt;/h5&gt;</string>
